These are small tiny scripts, which you are more than welcome to use.
I wanted to learn to code python in Cinema 4D, and had a hard time learning just a little bit of it, because I had a hard time understanding some of the documentation.
You can take a look at how the scripts where made, and it might help you understand some of it better!
