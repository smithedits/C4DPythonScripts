These are small tiny scripts, which you are more than welcome to use.<br />
I wanted to learn to code python in Cinema 4D, and had a hard time learning just a little bit of it, since the documentation is quite hard to understand for some of us.<br />
<br /> You can take a look at how the scripts were made, and it might help you understand some of it better!
